Flashing Guide:
* OTA is recommended.

If you are not Flashing via OTA, then follow the steps below

* Reboot to bootloader.
* Download vendor_boot.img and boot.img
* On the terminal, enter -
	fastboot flash boot boot.img
	fastboot flash vendor_boot vendor_boot.img
	fastboot reboot recovery
* On the recovery, go to install > adb sideload and enter
	adb sideload rom.zip (change "rom" to the name of the rom zip")
* reboot back to recovery and format data and reboot to system
* Flashing with latest OFOX recovery works now.

**Before start flashing.....**

- Always have backup of your internal storage
- Use TWRP recovery meant for Android 14 -: [HERE](https://t.me/chaitanyabuilds/121396)
- To retain TWRP recovery after rom flash, don't forget to tick the option "Automatically Reflash TWRP after flashing a rom" in recovery. Else TWRP will be replaced by recovery from rom

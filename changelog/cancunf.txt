• Update AVB rollback index from V1TDS35M.83-20-5-3.
• Install apex for clearkey service.
• Switch to regular AIDL Wi-Fi HAL over the lazy HAL as we don't need to defer initialization of Wi-Fi.
• Move to reference fastboot AIDL service.
• Cleanup Lights AIDL HAL.
• Build DisplayFeatures - A package that exposes toggles and QS tiles for HBM and CABC(page is located in display).
• Update blobs and firmware to V1TDS35M.83-20-5-5.

• Drop deprecated max_comp_streams attribute for ZRAM.
• Set ramdisk type for DLKM vendor_ramdisk fragment.
• Stop reserving space twice for journaling as we already do it in fstab.
• Define rounded_corner_radius overlay to make biometric prompt be rounded.
• Set biometric_dialog_corner_size to 155px to make the biometric prompt be even more rounded.
• Rewrite Lights AIDL HAL to Rust.
• Implement adjustable strength flashlight support.
• Set SurfaceFlinger min uclamp to 30% to reduce janks.
• Mark ACTION_UP events in TouchKeyHandler of MotoActions as handled to prevent a conflict with platform side actions.
• Be efficient and accurate with wakelocks in TouchKeyHandler of MotoActions.

• Decrease reserve_root value to 32768 to match Pixel behavior.
• Set readahead_size_kb=128 to system, vendor, product, system_ext and data to avoid memory pressure.
• Remove noflush_merge option from userdata as our UFS storage is not cheap.
• Use HintManager for HWUI for better CPU scheduling.
• Drop MTK RPS module.
• Remove unused MTK audio codecs as AOSP's software codecs are objectively superior.
• Disable Skia tracing by default to reduce jank.
• Disable sf EGL image tracking as it is a surfaceflinger debugging feature.
• Downscale task snapshots to 70% to save memory without a noticeable loss in quality.
• Update blobs and firmware to V1TDS35M.83-20-5-6.
